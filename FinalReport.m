Initially for this project i planned to include all the number keys and make the calculation only using the buttons and 
it was approved by LA Miguel Moreno. But I decided to use the edit boxes to type in the input instead of the number buttons and changed the 
the buttons for calculation type from push button to radio button. And it was approved by LA Ryan Martz. In this project I had some struggles 
in using the buttongroups but i was able to write all the other parts without help. For the buttongroups I went to LA office hours and
Emme Campbell helped me to make finishing touches. In the future I am hoping to use gui for class or for work but I am not sure what i will use 
it for yet.
